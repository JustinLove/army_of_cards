# Army of Cards

Client mod which creates custom server mods using Galactic War cards.

## Preparation

Use the "Army of Cards" button on the start screen to open the builder. The "Create Server Mod" button at the bottom will write out a new server mod using the selections you made, and register it with Community Mods Manager.

You may have multiple armies with different selections. Each army should have a different name.

Select an army to activate it's card selection. Select start card/loadout, and then any number of additional cards.

Subcommanders and slots are not used. You can add allied AI commanders in the lobby as normal, if you want.

## Playing

In the lobby, the game host can select a tag to use for each army. Note this is army level, not player level.

Unfortunately an extra reload will be triggered when reconnecting to a game using spec tags.
